<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>With a multifaceted educational background encompassing a Level 3/4 BTEC Foundation Diploma in Art, Design and Graphics, 
  an Access Course in Psychobiology for Health Professionals with Distinction, and a First Class Honours BSc in Design, 
  Enterprise & Innovation.</p>

<p> I've cultivated a versatile skill set spanning design, psychology, and engineering. Coupled with work experiences as a 
  Sales Representative, Teaching Assistant and Business Travel Consultant, I possess exceptional interpersonal and 
  organisational abilities.</p>

<p>Furthermore, my proficiency in 3D prototyping, SOLIDWORKS, and Unity, positions me effectively for data annotation tasks
   aligning technical expertise with a creative mindset. My vision is to create my own design studio to bring professionals/creatives 
   from  completely different industries together to develop immersive products, technologies and therapies for mental health & interactive
    art experiences as a means of storytelling. To help make peoples lives a little easier. And for their stories to be heard.</p>
